# Context
This regression predicts housing prices in King County, USA.
This was a project in the course "Machine Learning" which I took in my second semester of my second year in my Computer Science degree in Reichman University.
In this project I implemented Linear Regression once with 2 dimensions, and once with many features, and also Polynomial Regression.
All I used to create my code was Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for visualizasion. 
All the calaculations and steps are explained.

Hope You Enjoy!
